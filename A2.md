# **A1 Futures**

1. **FORECASTING**** / FUTURES:**
 Near: 1-10 Years (Building can only be built of materials available from the earth)Establish a lunar scientific research base, +op new building materials whose main material source is the moon. Medium: 10-40 (Research new methods for building materials and combinations of materials from the earth and the moon)
 Far: 40-100 (Building can be built solely from materials available at the moon which are financially and environmentally reasonably) structures that can withstand lunar weather conditions, potential impacts, and seismic activity.

1. **META DISCIPLINARY SYSTEMS:** Building Materials and Skins made out of moon materials (something like concrete moon) which are easy, fast, cheap and environmentally friendly. Convert lunar regolith into living soil and build a huge transparent dome for greenhouse cultivation. The plants grown can absorb organic matter produced by human metabolism and absorb carbon dioxide and convert it into oxygen. In this way, self-supply of resources can be gradually realized

2. **TARGET:**
 Being able to go to exoplanets and build sustainable buildings from the resources available at the sites.

**Why this project?**
Because the earth is getting overpopulated and is at the verge of not being sustainable anymore. A solution to this is to find a new planet that can sustain life as we know it. Furthermore it is an opportunity to figure out our place in the universe and achieve more understanding of the underlying physics. This project is a leap for further explorations and lays the foundation for the future.

**Why planet B?**
Earth is not a place to live anymore and humans need a new home. Planet B is within the habitable range of it's star. At the same time, the number of humans will inevitably continue to increase in the future, so habitation on extraterrestrial planets will inevitably be a problem faced by humans. With the current level of technological development, planet B is undoubtedly the best development target. In the future, planet B can also be used as a springboard to develop exploration of other planets.

**Building Design Genes**
Material.

**Planet B focus**

The ultimate goal is to fully utilize the local resources of the moon and establish a lunar construction system. Establish rocket launch capabilities on the surface of the moon, use the moon as a springboard between the earth and the moon, and send humans to other planets

# Week 3

**Future gaps:**

We are unable to make building material from resources available on the moon. In addition we don't have the knowledge for how the material behaves on the moon. We also have a lack of design standards and manuals for constructing on the moon, as this hasn't been done before. In addition, using new materials usually brings further problems, and we don't know the lifetime expectancy of the material available on the moon.

**System requirements:**

As the project takes place on the moon, it can be assumed that the conditions will be roughly the same in different locations on the moon. The base should be able to withstand the extreme environment, which includes extreme temperatures, no atmosphere, no air, no water, radiation,less gravity, seismic activity. It is also vital that the material will be able to seal the inside from the outside, creating an airtight base that can be used without a spacesuit.

**System features:**

Airtight material: Not needed from the beginning, but will be needed in order to make the base sustainable for living for extended periods. In the early stages the base can be used as a shelter for vehicles and other equipment, however the main goal should be to obtain a livable base early on.

Strength: The material should be able to withstand its own dead load, load from people and machines, moonquakes and possibly a direct hit from a meteoroid. In the early stages it would be acceptable to only withstand dead load, live load and moonquakes. Long term it should be able to withstand a direct hit from a meteoroid, meaning it wouldn't result in a total collapse of the entire moon base. This requires the moon base to consist of several parts that can function on their own.

Portability: Made of resources on the moon and a small amount of resources on the earthï¼ŒThe lunar surface is rich in oxygen, iron, aluminum, silicon and other elements, which can be used to make building materials such as concrete, glass and metal alloys. Because the cost of transporting materials from the earth is very high, building materials should be obtained locally to save the cost of moving goods back and forth.

**System examples:**

[https://www.sci.news/othersciences/materials/starcrete-11753.html](https://www.sci.news/othersciences/materials/starcrete-11753.html)

Concrete. Composites. Bricks.

We already have building walls on the earth, but these are not airtight. Furthermore the heat loss with these walls would be too much on the moon.

**System analysis:**

It can be analyzed with both physical testing and computer modeling. Furthermore calculations can be used to verify the chosen solutions.

Mechanical Performance testing

Thermal Performance testing

Radiation Resistance testing

Microgravity Resistance testing

Chemical Stability testing

Optical and Thermal Radiative Characteristics testing

3D Printing Performance testing

These tests will necessitate specialized laboratories and equipment, along with extensive research and experimentation on Earth. Subsequently, there might be a need to transport the material to the Moon for further testing. Additionally, research and testing equipment simulating lunar surface conditions can be used to validate the performance of the new lunar concrete-like material. Ultimately, a comprehensive series of tests can demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the new material in the lunar environment.

**Future case:**

Humans are living in moon habitats for their first decades. From the comfort of the moon habitat, humans can look at planet earth, whenever it's on the horizon. Visiting a neighboring habitat is just a step away. The moon vehicles are parked in the garage and will bring people safely to their destination.

Recently, the moon is getting independent from the earth and getting all of its needs and resources on the moon. From daily needs of humans which is food and fuel to all kinds of materials including structural materials as well.

There are greenhouses for growing vegetables which are the main part of the moon's cuisine.

One of the revolutionary technologies which is being used a lot on the moon is industrial 3D printers. From the beginning they started to print structural materials for mass producing pre-cast buildings and later advancements made them able to print almost everything.

The moon habitat is able to withstand the most extreme temperatures and moon quakes.

New foundation systems of buildings are able to tolerate even the most powerful moonquakes.

There are new energy shields equipped a few hundred meters from the surface to block almost all meteoroids hitting the moon everyday. In addition, they keep the temperature normal, which were the biggest safety challenges for moon settlers.

David Martinez moved to the moon a few years ago. He is a civil engineering student who wants to challenge himself to provide better living opportunities for moon settlers. Beside a lot of challenges he had when he started his new life on the moon, there are many interesting things here now.

Like other students he wakes up every morning, prepares his breakfast and heads to MTU (Moon's Technical University). They have a couple hours of lectures in different subjects every day or sometimes they go to labs for experimental courses.

He also has a part time job in a club as bartender but he just works just on weekends.

The daily activities of people on the moon are similar to people on the earth, but in different ways.

David studied alot about the early civil engineering problems humans faced by living on the moon. The earliest problem was transferring structural materials from earth to moon which was expensive,limited and time demanding. After a while humans found that if they want to live on moon they need to start producing these materials from moon with just some resources from earth. So "moon concerette" has been invented which was an interesting idea and after a while 3D printed materials took some part of cunstractution materials.

They had thousands of different experiments and failure but finally they could address the solutions.

Although, this is human's early steps to live one the moon and they need to learn alot but happily they are solving their problems and getting successful.
